You notice one of your crew members does 
not seem to be acting like themselves.
Once they mutter something about the 
new Mad Max movie only being average,
you know for sure they have gone crazy.
The crew member turns violent and starts
shouting "REDRUM" over and over, so 
clearly they need to be dealt with.
