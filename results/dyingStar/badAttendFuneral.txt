You and your crew attend the funeral. You're
very out of place, and feel quite unwelcome.
after a few minutes of silently paying your

hurls the microphone at your ship.
It clangs off the side, seemingly without
doing any damage. As you fly away you notice
a strange knocking somewhere in the engine.
